# Software Implementation (Second Project)

This software is a location system simplified using python3.10 with Flask and persistency using sqlite3.

## How use this code?

Ensure sqlite3 is installed.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run this code is very easy :)

Create your data if not exists

```bash
python3 models.py
```

```bash
python3 app.py
```
